## 🌱 Growth Mindset
> "Curious about exploring new knowledge and turning what I learn into real results."

I'm convinced that learning programming is not a straight path achieved overnight,  
but a journey of continuous progress through **repeated practice and hands-on projects**.  
That’s why I keep building small projects and documenting my learning process,  
step by step moving toward my goal of becoming a backend engineer.
